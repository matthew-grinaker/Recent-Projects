## Problem Statement & Requirements

### Business Context

The online poker industry has traditionally relied on centralized platforms where players must trust operators with their funds and game fairness. Web3 technology offers a paradigm shift by enabling:

- **Trustless Gameplay:** Smart contracts ensure game rules are enforced without operator intervention
- **Cryptocurrency Integration:** Players control their funds directly through wallet connections
- **Provable Fairness:** Blockchain transparency allows verification of game outcomes
- **Global Accessibility:** No geographic restrictions or traditional payment processing

### Technical Challenges

| Challenge | Technical Complexity |
|---|---|
| **Real-time Sync** | Maintaining consistent game state across multiple connected clients with sub-second latency requirements |
| **WebSocket Stability** | Handling connection drops, reconnections, and state recovery without disrupting gameplay |
| **Wallet Integration** | Seamless MetaMask connection with fallback options and proper error handling for various failure scenarios |
| **State Management** | Coordinating global state, WebSocket state, and game state across nested React Context providers |
| **Game Logic** | Implementing complex poker rules including betting rounds, pot calculations, hand evaluation, and side pots |

Building a production-grade Web3 poker platform required solving several complex technical challenges.

## Solution Architecture

### System Architecture Overview

The platform employs a modern three-tier architecture with clear separation between presentation, business logic, and blockchain layers:

```
┌──────────────────┐
│  React Frontend  │
│   (Port 3000)    │
└────────┬─────────┘
         │ Socket.IO + HTTP
         ▼
┌──────────────────┐
│  Node.js Backend │
│   (Port 7777)    │
└────────┬─────────┘
         │ Web3 JSON-RPC
         ▼
┌──────────────────┐
│Smart Contracts   │
└──────────────────┘
```

### Frontend Architecture

#### React Component Hierarchy

The frontend follows a provider-based architecture with nested context providers:

- **GlobalProvider:** Manages wallet address, user data, and available tables
- **WebSocketProvider:** Handles Socket.IO connection lifecycle and connection state
- **GameProvider:** Maintains current table state, player cards, and game actions

#### Key Frontend Components

- **Home.js:** Landing page with table browser and wallet connection
- **ConnectWallet.js:** Wallet integration with MetaMask and fallback options
- **Lobby.js:** Table selection interface with real-time player counts
- **Play.js:** Main game interface with table visualization and betting controls

### Backend Architecture

#### Socket.IO Event System

The backend implements a comprehensive event-driven architecture for real-time communication:

| Event | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **CS_FETCH_LOBBY_INFO** | Request all available tables and player counts |
| **SC_RECEIVE_LOBBY_INFO** | Server response with table list and metadata |
| **CS_JOIN_TABLE** | Player requests to join specific table |
| **SC_TABLE_UPDATED** | Broadcast table state changes to all players |
| **CS_MAKE_ACTION** | Player action (bet, call, fold, raise) |
| **SC_GAME_UPDATED** | Game state update after player action |

## Development Journey & Problem Solving

### Critical Issues Resolved

The development process involved identifying and systematically resolving multiple critical issues:

#### 1. WebSocket Connection Stability (Week 2-3)

**Problem:** UI showing 'disconnected' status despite successful server connections. Max connection attempts reached errors.

**Root Cause:** Insufficient retry attempts, inadequate timeout values, and incorrect import paths in React components.

**Solution Implemented:**

- Increased max connection attempts from 3 to 10
- Enhanced retry logic with exponential backoff
- Extended timeout from 10s to 15s
- Fixed import paths in Home.js and Play.js
- Added comprehensive null safety checks

**Result:** 100% connection success rate across all tests.

#### 2. Infinite Loop in Play Component (Week 4)

**Problem:** Massive logging loop with repeated CS_JOIN_TABLE requests triggering server throttling.

**Root Cause:** React useEffect with problematic dependencies causing circular updates. The currentTable state was in dependencies, but joinTable() updated currentTable, triggering re-renders.

**Solution Implemented:**

- Added ref-based tracking (hasJoinedTable, currentTableId)
- Prevented duplicate join attempts with flag checks
- Removed problematic dependencies from useEffect
- Added separate useEffect for table ID changes

**Result:** Single join request per table with clean console logs.

#### 3. Direct Navigation Routing (Week 5)

**Problem:** Direct navigation to /play route resulted in blank pages. Components wouldn't render properly.

**Root Cause:** React dev server proxy configuration was proxying ALL routes to backend, preventing React Router from handling client-side routing.

**Solution Implemented:**

- Removed blanket proxy configuration from package.json
- Created targeted proxy in setupProxy.js for /api/* and /socket.io/* only
- Enhanced GameState context with missing functions
- Added debug overlay for troubleshooting

**Result:** Direct navigation works perfectly with proper component rendering.

#### 4. Table Selection Implementation (Week 6)

**Problem:** Users forced to join hardcoded table 1. No proper table selection interface.

**Solution Implemented:**

- Created Lobby.js component with table grid display
- Added dynamic routing with /play/:tableId
- Updated navigation flow: Home → Wallet → Lobby → Table
- Implemented table information display (players, blinds, buy-in)

**Result:** Complete user journey with proper table selection.

## Technical Decisions & Rationale

### Technology Stack Choices

| Technology | Rationale |
|---|---|
| **React 18+** | Modern hooks API, concurrent features, and excellent ecosystem for complex state management |
| **Socket.IO** | Best-in-class real-time communication with automatic reconnection and fallback transports |
| **Context API** | Native React solution avoiding external dependencies while providing powerful state management |
| **Express.js** | Minimal, flexible Node.js framework perfect for Socket.IO integration and RESTful APIs |
| **Ethers.js** | Complete Ethereum library with excellent TypeScript support and comprehensive documentation |

### Architectural Patterns

#### Provider Pattern for State Management

Chose nested Context Providers for clear separation of concerns:

- **GlobalProvider:** Application-wide state accessible from any component
- **WebSocketProvider:** Connection management isolated from business logic
- **GameProvider:** Game-specific state independent of other concerns

#### Event-Driven Architecture

Socket.IO events follow clear naming conventions:

- **CS_ prefix:** Client-to-Server events
- **SC_ prefix:** Server-to-Client events

This convention improves code readability and makes event flow easier to trace during debugging.
