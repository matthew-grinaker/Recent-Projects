## Database Design

### Core Entities

#### Event Entity

| Column | Type | Constraints | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `event_id` | UUID | PRIMARY KEY | Unique event identifier |
| `event_name` | VARCHAR(255) | NOT NULL | Event display name |
| `event_date` | TIMESTAMP | NOT NULL | Event date and time |
| `location` | VARCHAR(500) | NOT NULL | Venue address |
| `status` | ENUM | NOT NULL | Planning, Active, Completed |
| `created_by` | UUID | FK → users | Event creator reference |

The Event entity is the central aggregate root representing a single event instance.

#### Budget Entity

| Column | Type | Constraints | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `budget_id` | UUID | PRIMARY KEY | Unique budget identifier |
| `event_id` | UUID | FK → events | Associated event |
| `category` | VARCHAR(100) | NOT NULL | Talent, Production, etc. |
| `planned_amount` | DECIMAL(15,2) | NOT NULL | Initial budget amount |
| `actual_amount` | DECIMAL(15,2) | DEFAULT 0 | Actual spent amount |
| `vat_rate` | DECIMAL(5,2) | DEFAULT 15.00 | VAT percentage |

Budget entity captures both planned and actual financial data with hierarchical categorization.

### Indexing Strategy

Optimized indexes have been designed based on query pattern analysis:

- Composite index on (event_id, category) for budget queries
- GiST index on event_date for temporal queries
- Full-text search index on event_name, location
- Partial indexes on status for active event filtering

---

## Security & Access Control Architecture

### Authentication Flow

The system implements OAuth 2.0 with JWT tokens for stateless authentication:

1. User submits credentials to `/api/v1/auth/login`
2. System validates credentials and checks MFA status
3. MFA challenge sent via SMS or authenticator app
4. Upon successful MFA, system issues access token (15-minute TTL) and refresh token (7-day TTL)
5. Access token contains user_id, roles, and permissions as JWT claims
6. API Gateway validates JWT signature on every request

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

The system defines seven distinct roles with hierarchical permissions:

| Role | Permissions | Data Visibility |
|---|---|---|
| **Event Organizer** | Full CRUD on events, budgets, suppliers; approval authority | All data including supplier details |
| **Partner** | Read budgets/reports; approve budgets; track payments | Financial summaries only (configurable supplier visibility) |
| **Sponsor** | Read-only access to ROI reports and sponsorship metrics | No supplier details; aggregated financial data |
| **Supplier** | Submit quotes/invoices; view own submissions; upload documents | Own data only; no access to other suppliers or budget |
| **Accountant** | Read all financial data; export reports; reconciliation tools | Full financial visibility; no modification rights |

### Data Encryption

- **At Rest:** AES-256 encryption for database (PostgreSQL with pgcrypto extension)
- **In Transit:** TLS 1.3 for all API communications
- **Field-Level:** Additional encryption for sensitive fields (bank details, SSNs) using AWS KMS
- **Document Storage:** S3 server-side encryption with customer-managed keys

---

## API & Integration Strategy

### Howler Ticketing Integration

The Howler integration is critical for automated revenue tracking. Implementation approach:

#### Integration Architecture

- **Webhook Configuration:** Register webhook endpoints with Howler for real-time event notifications
- **Polling Mechanism:** Scheduled job (every 15 minutes) polls Howler API for ticket sales updates as fallback
- **Data Synchronization:** ETL pipeline transforms Howler data format to internal revenue schema
- **Idempotency:** Transaction IDs prevent duplicate processing of webhook events

#### Data Mapping

| Howler Field | Internal Field | Transformation |
|---|---|---|
| event_id | event_id | Direct mapping |
| ticket_type | revenue_subcategory | Enumeration mapping |
| tickets_sold | quantity | Integer conversion |
| gross_revenue | revenue_amount | Currency normalization |

### RESTful API Design Principles

- **Resource-Oriented:** Endpoints represent business entities (/events, /budgets, /suppliers)
- **HTTP Verbs:** GET (read), POST (create), PUT (full update), PATCH (partial update), DELETE (remove)
- **Status Codes:** 200 OK, 201 Created, 400 Bad Request, 401 Unauthorized, 403 Forbidden, 404 Not Found, 500 Internal Server Error
- **Versioning:** URL path versioning (/api/v1/) for backward compatibility
- **Pagination:** Cursor-based pagination for large datasets (limit, offset parameters)
- **Error Format:** Standardized JSON error responses with error codes and messages

## Decision Logic & Business Rules

### Budget Approval Workflow

The budget approval process follows a state machine pattern with clearly defined transitions:

#### State Transition Rules

- **DRAFT → ORGANIZER_REVIEW:** Triggered when organizer submits budget for internal review
- **ORGANIZER_REVIEW → DRAFT:** Organizer requests modifications
- **ORGANIZER_REVIEW → PARTNER_APPROVAL:** Organizer approves, sends to all partners for approval
- **PARTNER_APPROVAL → ORGANIZER_REVIEW:** Any partner rejects budget
- **PARTNER_APPROVAL → APPROVED:** All partners approve budget (unanimous consent required)
- **APPROVED → LOCKED:** Budget locked after event start date, no further modifications allowed

#### Business Rules

- Partner approval requires minimum 24-hour review period before auto-approval timeout
- Budget modifications > 10% of total budget require re-approval from all partners
- Notifications sent via email and in-app alerts for each state transition

### Supplier Visibility Logic

Supplier information visibility is configurable per event based on sponsor preferences:

- **Full Visibility:** Sponsors can see supplier names, contact details, quotes, and invoices
- **Partial Visibility:** Sponsors see aggregate costs per category but not individual supplier details
- **No Visibility:** Sponsors only see total budget summaries without category breakdown

Visibility setting configured per event at creation time, modifiable only by event organizer.

### Payment Allocation Rules

When partners share event costs, payment allocation follows these principles:

- Partner shares defined as percentage splits (e.g., 50/50, 60/40)
- Each invoice can be paid by one or multiple partners
- System tracks: Amount paid per partner, Outstanding balance per partner, Total contributions per partner
- At event completion, profit/loss distributed according to partner share percentages
- Distribution report generated showing: Total revenue, Total expenses, Net profit/loss, Distribution per partner

## Risk Management & Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation Strategy |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Howler API changes** | High | Medium | Abstraction layer, version monitoring, fallback manual entry |
| **Data migration errors** | High | Medium | Comprehensive ETL testing, manual verification, rollback procedures |
| **Security breach** | Critical | Low | Penetration testing, security audits, encryption at rest and in transit |
| **Performance bottlenecks** | Medium | Medium | Load testing, caching strategy, database read replicas, CDN |
| **User adoption resistance** | High | High | Comprehensive training, change management, gradual rollout, support team |
