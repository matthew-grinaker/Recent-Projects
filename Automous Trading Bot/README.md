## Business Requirements & Problem Statement

### Core Challenges Addressed

Manual trading execution presents several critical limitations that this system was designed to overcome:

**Latency and Emotional Bias:** Human traders cannot match the speed and consistency of automated execution, and emotional decision-making often leads to poor trade management.

**24/7 Market Monitoring:** Financial markets operate continuously across global time zones. Manual monitoring is unsustainable and leads to missed opportunities.

**Strategy Consistency:** Maintaining discipline in executing a predefined strategy is challenging for manual traders, leading to inconsistent results.

**Position Management Complexity:** Managing multiple positions, calculating average entry prices, and tracking P&L across pyramiding strategies requires sophisticated systems.

**Broker Integration:** Different brokers require different APIs and authentication methods, creating integration complexity.

### Solution Requirements

The system was designed to meet the following comprehensive requirements:

| Requirement Category | Specific Requirements |
|---|---|
| **Webhook Integration** | Receive and validate TradingView webhook alerts; Support JSON payload parsing with signature verification; Rate limiting and request validation |
| **Position Management** | Support position pyramiding with average price calculations; Track multiple positions per strategy independently; Maintain position history and trade logs |
| **Broker Integration** | Extensible broker abstraction layer; Support for mock broker (testing) and production brokers; Unified interface for order placement and management |
| **Monitoring & Alerting** | Real-time position monitoring for stop-loss/take-profit; Telegram notifications for trades and errors; Comprehensive logging and error tracking |
| **Deployment & Reliability** | Docker containerization for easy deployment; Systemd service configuration for production; Database migration system for schema evolution |

## Solution Architecture

### High-Level Architecture

The trading bot follows a modular, layered architecture that separates concerns and enables independent testing and deployment of components:

```
┌─────────────┐     ┌──────────────┐     ┌────────────┐
│ TradingView │────→│   FastAPI    │────→│  Trading   │
│   Webhook   │     │   Server     │     │   Logic    │
└─────────────┘     └──────────────┘     └────────────┘
                           │                    │
                           ▼                    ▼
                    ┌──────────────┐     ┌────────────┐
                    │  PostgreSQL  │     │   Broker   │
                    │   Database   │     │    API     │
                    └──────────────┘     └────────────┘
```

### Component Breakdown

#### 1. FastAPI Web Server

The entry point for all webhook requests and API interactions. Responsibilities include:

- Receiving and validating webhook requests from TradingView
- Rate limiting and request authentication
- RESTful API endpoints for system monitoring and management
- Request logging and error handling

#### 2. Trading Core Logic

The brain of the system, containing strategy execution logic:

- Strategy pattern implementation for different trading strategies
- Position management including pyramiding and averaging
- Risk management calculations
- Trade execution coordination with broker layer

#### 3. Broker Abstraction Layer

Provides a unified interface for interacting with different broker APIs:

- BaseBroker abstract class defining the interface
- MockBroker for testing and development
- Production broker implementations (e.g., HerenyaBroker)
- Factory pattern for broker instantiation

#### 4. Database Layer

PostgreSQL database with SQLAlchemy ORM providing:

- Position tracking with entry details and current status
- Trade history for performance analysis
- Configuration storage for strategies and bots
- Webhook log retention for debugging

#### 5. Background Monitor Service

A separate process that continuously monitors positions:

- Polls broker APIs for current prices
- Checks stop-loss and take-profit conditions
- Executes automatic exit orders when conditions are met
- Sends notifications via Telegram

## Technical Implementation Details

### Technology Stack

| Component | Technology & Rationale |
|---|---|
| **Backend Framework** | FastAPI: Modern async Python framework with automatic OpenAPI documentation, type hints, and high performance |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL + SQLAlchemy: Reliable relational database with excellent Python ORM support |
| **API Server** | Uvicorn: Lightning-fast ASGI server with excellent async support |
| **Notifications** | Telegram Bot API: Reliable messaging platform with rich API for sending alerts and updates |
| **Deployment** | Docker + Systemd: Containerized deployment with system service management for reliability |

### Database Schema Design

The database schema was designed to support complex position management while maintaining data integrity.

#### Core Tables

- **trading_bots:** Configuration for each trading bot instance including webhook keys and risk parameters
- **instruments:** Trading instruments (stocks, crypto, futures) with symbol mappings
- **strategy_configs:** Strategy-specific settings including position sizing and risk management rules
- **current_positions:** Active positions with average entry price, quantity, unrealized P&L
- **position_entries:** Individual entries for pyramided positions
- **trade_history:** Closed trades with realized P&L, exit reasons, and performance metrics
- **webhook_logs:** Audit trail of all webhook requests for debugging

### Position Management Logic

One of the most complex aspects of the system is position management, particularly with pyramiding support.

#### Entry Logic

1. Receive entry signal from TradingView with action type and price
2. Check if position exists for this bot/instrument/direction
3. If new position: Create position record and place initial order
4. If adding to position: Check pyramiding limits, calculate new average price, place additional order
5. Update position record with new average entry price and total quantity
6. Send notification with position details

#### Exit Logic

1. Receive exit signal or stop-loss/take-profit trigger
2. Retrieve current position details including all entries
3. Calculate realized P&L: (Exit Price - Average Entry) × Quantity
4. Place exit order with broker
5. Move position to trade_history with final P&L
6. Send notification with trade summary
