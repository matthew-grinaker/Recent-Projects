# Trading Bot Project Summary

## Overview

The Trading Bot is now a complete application capable of executing trades based on TradingView webhook signals. The bot uses an RSI strategy by default but is designed to be extensible for additional strategies. The system manages positions, calculates profit and loss, and includes a monitoring service to handle stop loss and take profit conditions.

## Implemented Features

1. **WebHook Reception System**
   - FastAPI endpoints for receiving TradingView alerts
   - JSON payload validation
   - Webhook signature verification
   - Rate limiting protection
   - Detailed webhook logging

2. **Trading Logic**
   - RSI strategy implementation
   - Position management (open, add, close)
   - Support for pyramiding positions
   - Stop loss and take profit handling
   - Extensible strategy framework

3. **Broker Integration**
   - Base broker interface
   - Mock broker for testing
   - Herenya broker implementation
   - Broker factory for extensibility

4. **Database Structure**
   - Position tracking
   - Trade history
   - Configuration management
   - Webhook logs
   - Schema versioning

5. **Notification System**
   - Telegram integration
   - Trade notifications
   - Error alerts
   - System updates
   - Extensible notification framework

6. **Monitoring System**
   - Background position monitoring
   - Automatic stop loss and take profit execution
   - Price cache management
   - System health monitoring

7. **Deployment**
   - Docker containerization
   - Docker Compose setup
   - Systemd service files
   - Installation script

## Key Components

### API Endpoints

- `/webhook/{webhook_key}` - Main webhook endpoint for TradingView signals
- `/health` - Health check endpoint
- `/bots` - List all active trading bots
- `/positions` - List all open positions
- `/trades` - List recent trade history

### Database Schema

- `trading_bots` - Bot configurations
- `instruments` - Trading instruments
- `strategy_configs` - Strategy configurations
- `current_positions` - Active positions
- `position_entries` - Individual position entries
- `trade_history` - Closed trades
- `webhook_logs` - Webhook request logs
- `schema_versions` - Database migration tracking

### Broker Implementations

- `BaseBroker` - Abstract base class for all brokers
- `MockBroker` - Simulated broker for testing
- `HerenyaBroker` - Integration with Herenya trading platform

### Strategy Framework

- `BaseStrategy` - Abstract base class for all strategies
- `RSIStrategy` - RSI-based trading strategy implementation

## Getting Started
